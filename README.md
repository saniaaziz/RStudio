# RStudio
Trying to use R with GitHub

Things I did:

1. Install Git on my computer. Have no idea what the options were, so I just went with the default ones
2. RStudio does not automatically recognise that Git has been installed. Have to open Git Bash and enter the following lines of code: 

git config --global user.name "John Doe"

git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

There are lots of other directions to follow; I'll just link the website from where I copied the code and the directions to link GitHub with RStudio. Here's the link: http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/using-github-with-r-and-rstudio/
Everything worked out just fine, although I'm having issues "pushing" files to GitHub servers. Hope to resolve this soon!
